# The_Village_of_Testing

For a school project, we needed to create a series of functions and classes that simulate a growing village. Each worker is processed as an object, and they have a limited amount of resources to build up buildings with. The goal is for the community to grow large enough to build a castle. For this, they must collect resources, build buildings, and not die of starvation at the same time.

The application was developed using C# and tested using moq.
